# Code Running Service 

## Introduction
This module is designed to run a Python script / python text on a server and return the result or corresponding errors back to the client.

## Installation
Clone this module and run ```npm install``` to get all the necessary dependencies. 

For now, the server will run locally with a sample client (found in the ```/testing``` directory). To run it, run ```npm run test``` and open your browser to ```http://localhost:5000/```.

## Testing
3 test python scripts located in the ```/testing/testCodeScripts``` directory have been created for manual testing purposes.
